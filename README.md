# FRAP analysis for moving spots

Mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs) are moving structures within mitochondria organelles inside living cells. The TrackFRAP script was developed to automatized the data collection of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments videos by tracking the intensity recovery of MRGs after FRAP experiment.
